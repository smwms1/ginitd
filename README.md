# ginitd

ginitd is two main things: an init system and a service management scheme. The
init system can function without the service management scheme and vice versa,
though they come in the same package. It is sort of similar to runit, but some
major concepts differ.

**ginitd is currently in the pre-alpha stage and is not usable.** Not all of its
components have even been written yet, and it will need some time to mature and
for bugs (if any exist) to be squashed. I hope to release ginitd in the alpha
stage at some point in early 2025.

This is a screenshot of an older version of ginitd:
